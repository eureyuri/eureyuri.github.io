The full design process."},"slug":"go-ham-design","body":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Overview / The Problem</h2>\n<p>Our problem statement is that during quarantine, students are prone to developing sedentary lifestyles due to the closure of exercise facilities and discouragement of small gatherings. Thus, it is easy for students to lack the motivation to exercise. Our specific subproblem is to help students find their motivation. It is an important subproblem because exercise is an essential part of a healthy, balanced life that is too often overshadowed by school stress.\nOur design solution will encourage motivation through synced exercise video calls and gamification. For example, two friends may schedule a meet up to work out together and follow video instructions together while on the call. If a user wants to have a spontaneous workout and meet other Columbia students, they can visit virtual locations on the game map, each of which would be designated for a different type of exercise. Users can then easily find new friends to workout with while building a community within GoHam!</p>\n<p>A demo of the final product is available <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QBHqvb4yeXW58zZd1haGe-FJ6TtOf8Tn/view\">here</a></p>\n<p>This project was built as a group continuing on from my individual project <a href=\"https://www.eureyuri.codes/blog/work-out-design\">WorkOut!</a></p>\n<h2>Target User Population</h2>\n<p>Our target population is Columbia University students who may be less motivated to exercise due to COVID-19’s impact on student lifestyles. These students may have limited access to exercise due to the shutdown of gyms and discouragement of social gatherings.</p>\n<h2>Ambition</h2>\n<p>Arriving at this solution will be challenging because to address our problem statement successfully <strong>we had to find the right representations for motivation, exercise, and our users.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We had to come up with extrinsic rewards that would bolster and correlate with intrinsic motivation. We decided on: point level-up systems, positive network effects of social / peer pressure, progress bars, notifications, virtual avatars, and avatar customization.</li>\n<li>Representing exercise through a smartphone with video call integration is hard. Being watched can feel obtrusive and come with a host of privacy and self-image concerns. Thus, we have chosen to use virtual avatars, which allows users to have a certain amount of protection online and have independence from their physical image.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another major challenge we face is <strong>user retention</strong>. Since initial users of the app will inevitably be individuals, they will not have other users to work out with.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To increase retention rate, we implemented “easter eggs”, or sunflower seeds in our case, on the map so that individual users can click on this to work out alone but with high reward, which leads to faster level ups and customization.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Comparative Analysis</h2>\n<h4>1. My Fitness Pal Mobile App</h4>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t1i3p2wynjf8/5rtwwuyLV4q73Rlk6iAVRB/4058e60df8e4e8cb5e447c0f8509a713/____________________________2021-01-08_9.39.50.png\" alt=\"My Fitness Pal Mobile App\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>MyFitnessPal was designed to help people lose weight by promoting healthy eating and exercising. </li>\n<li>It allows users to keep track of their calorie count, find personalized workouts for their calorie targets, and post their weight loss journeys. </li>\n<li>It provides users with different options to customize their social feed. </li>\n<li>Users can share completed workouts or achievements with friends. </li>\n<li>At the top of the user’s feed, users can see the remaining amount of calories to burn for that day and other stats such as steps, food, and goals.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Evaluation</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>While this is a great app that helps users keep track of their own progress, this application does not serve our target population’s needs (being motivated to work out while under quarantine). </li>\n<li>While a user can see their friend’s workouts on their newsfeed, the app supports neither joint nor remote workout sessions.</li>\n<li>Users may only “thumb up” or “thumb down” their friend’s workout, which can limit social interactions within the platform--not to mention be a source of discouragement if a user is given a “thumbs down”</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2. NEOU App</h4>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t1i3p2wynjf8/4X5eI9Uzbom2Z1iQ40y0H7/ce5b7a89f5857f43146c3b8d6b02d426/____________________________2021-01-10_9.05.44.png\" alt=\"NEOU\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>A live streaming and on-demand fitness platform that offers workouts from 100+ studios and trainers available for you to complete with your friends and family. </li>\n<li>Users are motivated by badges for every workout milestone met. </li>\n<li>Based on your preferences, skill level, and comfort, the application also generates an algorithm that recommends instructors, classes, and programs.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Evaluation</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>While this is great for individuals to keep track of their workouts and maintain motivation, the app does not cater to users who want to work out with other friends or follow along with a group that is already working out together.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>3. Facebook Messenger</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Messenger is a video conferencing platform through which people can remotely exercise together. </li>\n<li>Users can chat and decide that they want to exercise together. They can coordinate a time and manually mark it in their individual calendars. </li>\n<li>Within a video call, they can search for exercises online together, screenshare, and work out synchronously at no time limit. </li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Evaluation</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Messenger is a poor solution in that for users to exercise together, they may need to coordinate across multiple platforms (e.g. Messenger, calendar, Google, timer) This creates a time-consuming hassle.</li>\n<li>Not a viable or sustainable solution for our subproblem of motivation. There is no source of motivation unless there is already a dedicated person on the other side.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>4. Our Solution</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>For our solution to be successful, we will address the following points where the prior applications do not:</li>\n<li>We will foster motivation with gamification (ie. incremental levels and rewards via customization.</li>\n<li>We will coordinate joint workouts between people who need exercise partners, by building a virtual map of exercise rooms. Such a map would help users feel a sense of exploration and build community on Go Ham!</li>\n<li>We will retain all the core functionalities of the three status quo apps detailed above. However, we will centralize needed features (a calendar, video conferencing, schedule, etc.) so that users do not waste time on multiple platforms.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Storyboards</h2>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t1i3p2wynjf8/491NsFUmNrRqhqImpJoJ0T/00f86d6caede21b4a449c6a9b53c42cb/____________________________2021-01-10_9.09.21.png\" alt=\"goham-storyboard1\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t1i3p2wynjf8/2xUO9h2YowOaPX579sOCTu/1bda3e50220e61e91256a59513d1129f/goham-storyboard2.png\" alt=\"goham-storyboard2\"></p>\n<h2>Hi-Fi Prototype</h2>\n<iframe style=\"border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2F4PgnNEHLbQL6OVU2rY6x5G%2Fgo-ham%3Fnode-id%3D157%253A224\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h2>Design Process</h2>\n<h4>Loop 1</h4>\n<h5>Design phase.</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>After consolidating our idea and prototyping the skeleton of our app, contextual inquiries were performed to determine what kind of parameter for stats (leveling up) would encourage the user most.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Prototyping phase.</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>Two versions of the stats for the home screen were lo-fi prototypes on paper, which were\ncalories and time spent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Evaluation phase.</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>We learned from the user that calories would be a better metric since time does not directly correspond to the intensity of the exercises and would not be an easy way to gauge how much effort you had spent.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Loop 2</h4>\n<h5>Design phase.</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>Our first contextual inquiry in this phase was devoted to seeing how well the current Figma appealed to a relevant user in our population. The user was shown the Figma and asked directed questions intended to inform design decisions, such as the following:</li>\n<li>Upon seeing this screen, would the amount of people in one place entice you to join or make you feel shy to join?</li>\n<li>Would you prefer an anthropomorphic [hamster] avatar or a human one?</li>\n<li>The user provided valuable feedback that encouraged us to trim down the number of ways we represent motivation on the app. </li>\n<li>For example, they stated that they were “lost in calories”, meaning that they did not understand the calorie counter on our original home screen. We have since moved towards using experience points as the main unit on our app. </li>\n<li>They also provided useful input encouraging us to keep our virtual human silhouette avatars, because they stated that human avatars represent “more degrees of freedom”.</li>\n<li>A second contextual inquiry gave us deeper insight into what our target population values and needs to stay motivated. </li>\n<li>The user described their most memorable workout experiences as ones where they had reached a major milestone in their fitness journey, whether it was in weight lifting or running pace, which inspired new features discussed in the next phase. </li>\n<li>The findings from this inquiry tied back to our focus on motivation, because users found that their motivation to exercise greatly stemmed from personal goals.</li>\n</ol>\n<h5>Prototyping phase.</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>InWe created the following additional features: a leaderboard, a comment section, icon customization, a gallery to document progress pictures, and a feature to input exercise goals.</li>\n<li>We incorporated findings from the second contextual inquiry into the Progress Milestones and Progress Pictures features. </li>\n<li>Although achieving a goal is an award in itself, we further incorporated more affordances for goals into the Leaderboard feature, which allows users to track and share their achievements with their friends and peers. </li>\n<li>The “icon customization” feature was designed to showcase the user's level progress and stir up a more competitive spirit amongst users. </li>\n<li>The user also suggested a comment section that we implemented as our Community Chat. This feature facilitates community building in our virtual gym much as one would in-person by allowing people to exchange advice, discuss workouts, and workout together.</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Evaluation phase.</h5>\n<ol>\n<li>One evaluation was conducted with a user experience designer at Google, who gave us a ‘crit’ to suggest improvements as per industry standards. While they enjoyed walking through the experience of our app, they suggested changes for GoHam’s look and feel.</li>\n<li>Standardizing our text with standard iOS/android mobile system font. This is what most popular apps do to minimize friction when users move between different apps on a phone.</li>\n<li>Increasing the font size of our app. In some frames, we used a size 6 font, whereas the smallest font at her company was 11.</li>\n<li>Addressing accessibility issues stemming from our usage of yellow and white; this produces low contrast.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t1i3p2wynjf8/3SY8jSo5DMOwdytsqA1GES/c8f0b193b6fa8f5df4a18efe37e74ee4/____________________________2021-01-10_9.27.43.png\" alt=\"goham-loop-colour\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixing alignment issues</li>\n<li>Implementing frames based on the <em>mobile</em> best practices rather than web best practices. For example, our Community chat frame was based upon Youtube’s web comment section. However, it was better to use a different, space-saving mobile version.</li>\n<li>A second evaluation was conducted using the Wizard of Oz technique. </li>\n<li>Through the contextual inquiry, we found that the user has an easy time navigating through the app, which means there is low stress in figuring out what to do sustaining the motivation. </li>\n<li>We also gained affirmation that the newly added progress album and milestones are indeed what our users are looking for. The user mentioned that the progress album is a good way for her to get motivated since she could see her improvements over time. </li>\n<li>She further continued that even if there was no progress made or she is doing worse, it would still motivate her since she knows that she is not doing well and needs to step up her game and exercise more to progress.</li>\n<li>One piece of constructive feedback we received was that it would be helpful for users to see which body areas the workout targets to assess whether or not the workout would help meet their goals</li>\n<li>Another user expressed their concern about profanity and negativity on the exercise community chat. This was an important risk that results from allowing users to communicate on the platform that had not been previously considered. Accordingly, we modified the community chat such that all users can view the chats, but only users who have participated in the exercise can comment to reduce the likelihood of menacing speech. Additionally, all chats have community guidelines and language filters that enforce censoring profanity and the option to report comments for misconduct to remove it from the chat.</li>\n<li>For the virtual avatars tracking movement in real-time we believe that it would be possible to implement pose tracking on mobile devices using vision networks deployed through the browser and libraries like ml5.js. Certainly, latency issues could crop up, but we could update our virtual avatars at slower frame rates and interpolate the motion--the main point is that people just get the <em>sense</em> t hat they are exercising with others in real time.</li>\n<li>The map function has now been adjusted to include a virtual location feature, so that when users open up their joint workouts, they are given a virtual background that represents a location near Columbia (ie. Riverside Park). This way, GoHam! can foster a sense of place. There are also opportunities to partner with local businesses and existing programs (ie. Dodge), which helps resolve one pain point for content generation / curation.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Design Solution</h2>\n<iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/empty-forest-xezkc?fontsize=14&theme=dark&view=preview\"\n     style=\"width:375px; height:850px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\"\n     title=\"empty-forest-xezkc\"\n     allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\"\n     sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"\n   ></iframe>\n<ul>\n<li>The app opens to a Home screen that consists of a user’s avatar, progress circle, user level, and leaderboard. The progress circle shows how many experience points users have earned so far and how many more are needed to reach the next level. At certain levels, users can customize their avatars with sweatbands and belts. We also present a leaderboard that generates positive competition and puts the user in the context of the GoHam community.</li>\n<li>From the navigation in the footer we can access the calendar tab. From the Calendar screen, when the user clicks on an upcoming workout at the scheduled time, they are led to a video call where they are able to exercise together with a partner. </li>\n<li>The Video Call screen shows a split-screen; the top half plays a pre-recorded video of an instructor demonstrating exercises, while the bottom half displays the pair working out. There is also a countdown timer to indicate how much time is left.</li>\n<li>When the user wants to find more people to work out with, they can navigate a virtual Map screen, which borrows locations from around Columbia. These locations will be the virtual rooms within which exercises like ‘Cardio’, ‘Yoga’ or ‘Weights’ take place in. Users can check how many other students are online in each location. </li>\n<li>When the user clicks join, they will be directed to a transition screen. This allows them to prepare themselves for the exercise call. </li>\n<li>Upon entering, they will see the virtual avatars of the other users in a gallery as well as the pre-recorded instructor video. (Groups may also cap the number of users in a call to ensure that workout is manageable and beneficial for everyone.) </li>\n<li>Additionally, there are occasionally sunflower seeds (top left on the map below) that encourage individual users to workout for more experience points.</li>\n<li>The Map Screen has a hamburger icon menu that directs us to the Exercise List view-- a full catalog of workouts users can join, schedule, or comment upon. </li>\n<li>As the user scrolls down to the bottom of the Exercise List, they will see the Dodge Gym Exercise List which advertises supplemental workout routines to participate in that are provided to go ham! by our sponsorship with Dodge Gym at Columbia University. </li>\n<li>When the user clicks Chat, they can check the Community Chat for user commentary on the selected workout. In the Add Schedule screen, they are able to schedule specific workouts (with friends) at certain times and frequencies.</li>\n<li>The Profile screen displays the user’s profile picture, avatar, past workout history with friends, and invited workouts (made from the Add Schedule screen). There are subpages for My Progress and My Milestones page where a user can see and set their progress.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Risks to Mitigate</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The biggest risks that we faced toward completing our project successfully was <strong>user incentive</strong> and <strong>user engagement</strong>. </li>\n<li>Our target population seeks the motivation to exercise regularly, and we strove to provide this through user interactions. We faced the risk of losing users and user incentives, because they are highly dependent upon one another. If there is no community, the user is just as alone in remote exercising as they were before.</li>\n<li>We have mitigated those risks by offering the users incentives derived from both their interactions with other users and their personalized interactions with the interface.</li>\n<li>Following the feedback from our initial contextual inquiries, we gamified our interface to appeal to users who would thrive on extrinsic rewards and competition. We created features such as leaderboards, leveling up, avatar outfit customization, secret and private “sunflower seeds” workouts, and exercise streaks.</li>\n<li>\n<p>In terms of technical implementations limitations, the biggest risks stem from three things: our interactive campus map, the virtual avatars that represent users workouts, and content curation.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The option for users to access workouts from Dodge Fitness on the application is a double edged sword because it promotes an influx of new content for users, but it also requires a means of sharing content.</li>\n<li>The interactive campus map is one of the most sophisticated components of our design solution because it must pull in map data and visualize it in an abstracted 3D.</li>\n<li>As of now, we are allowing the user the option to use a virtual avatar during group workouts with strangers. This addition would require pose tracking, which is not a commonplace feature on mobile apps.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>We plan to mitigate these risks resulting from our technical implementations by first forming a partnership with Dodge Gym that will benefit both parties such that our platform will have an option for an in-app purchase of a Dodge Gym’s fitness class membership such that all profit is given to Columbia and our users are able to directly access the content from the app. </li>\n<li>We will reduce the complexity of the interactive campus map by establishing it as a fixed model such that the locations are hard-coded into the platform by us and will not alter, vary or update with time.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Future Work</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Incorporate a more organizational framework for the scheduling feature of the application. From a user interface design perspective, this formatting doesn’t represent the usability heuristic “match between the system and the real world” efficiently. Additionally, they could set and view the total duration of the planned workout on the calendar.</li>\n<li>Display whether or not the users have the correct form and provide helpful tips to make sure users are targeting the correct muscles. One way we could do this is through highlighting “burn” areas during the workout to emphasize quality over quantity. </li>\n<li>Consolidated evaluation framework. Though we all did contextual inquiries, they were each conducted differently. Because we had less structure going into some of evaluation interviews, one interview session actually evolved into a UI grooming and co-design session. However, that was also in a sense an upside, since we were able to see the design solution from an unbiased and more distant lens, getting feedback beyond what was desired.</li>\n<li>Look into is the source of demotivation. Throughout our design process, our primary focus was on how to make users motivated. Now my question is, is there anything in our app that could potentially discourage our users. For example, one concern I have is the invitation system. The current design of the invitation is one way in that the inviter invites their friend when the inviter is free. Therefore, this could mean that there may be many occasions where this invitation will not work at first try and users would have to rely on other messaging apps, which risks our aim to make this an hassle-free app. Though our app may not need messaging functionalities, it may be beneficial if users can post their own schedule and free time by, for instance, synching their Google Calendar.</li>\n</ul>"}},"heroImage":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/t1i3p2wynjf8/1aSk6nM6f4W7Cf97xDtfx5/3b7671cd08c9423057594e608627b96f/goham.png"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"go-ham-design"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
