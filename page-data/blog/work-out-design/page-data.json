"},"slug":"work-out-design","body":{"childMarkdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>Overview / The Problem</h2>\n<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, some students are living in a small space where they are unable to exercise to be in a healthy state. This problem arises from multiple issues including the restriction of space, fear of getting the virus, and lack of proper schedule, human interactions, and motivation.</p>\n<p>The design solution tackles the sub-problem on motivation because often times, it is easier to start but harder to persevere. In my solution, the leveraging of motivation was done primarily through involving human interaction and a gaming component. For human interaction, two users of the app will be able to schedule a meet up to work out together through a video call and follow the displayed video instruction. In the gaming component, we employ an avatar that levels up as users spend more time exercising on the app. </p>\n<h2>Target User Population</h2>\n<p>My target population is college students living in a small space such as an apartment or dorm room during the COVID-19 pandemic. I decidede to focus on an user population that differs from me in order to practice building design empathy and designing what the users really need instead what I imagine they need.</p>\n<h2>Ambition</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>To have users start exercising in a small space, I had to not only focus on the physical restrictions but also, the mental aspects regarding motivation. </li>\n<li>Since motivation is not accurately quantifiable and can easily fluctuate, thinking of and inquiring about how to maintain motivation to my users was challenging. </li>\n<li>If users were not able to get motivated, they can easily quit and possibly never come back. </li>\n<li>For users who are using this app with a friend, it also depends on the other user if they will continue to use this app. If one from a couple quits, then we may risk losing two users at once. </li>\n<li>How to have users follow through and get into routine. </li>\n<li>Since the app functionality could be implemented by using a combination of preexisting apps, it is necessary to make my solution much simpler and unique so that users can use with ease and prefer this solution. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Contextual Inquiry</h2>\n<h4>User 1</h4>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t1i3p2wynjf8/21EhgUsDZVvGfQQaTpvjFv/668d728afd7889666a7469b53547baef/____________________________2021-01-09_11.27.52.png\" alt=\"workout-user1\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>University student in his senior year whose favorite exercise is cycling</li>\n<li>He spends most of his time in his room either studying, playing games, listening to music, or sleeping</li>\n<li>During the observation, I mainly observed him working on his desktop as well as him playing games, which is what he would usually do.</li>\n<li>I suggested if he could try to do some exercise but was told that his room was too small for his height to do anything including stretching.</li>\n<li>The first thing he mentioned was that although he does not exercise, he is always warning himself to do so. He is fully aware that his current lifestyle combined with his terrible sleep schedule is not a healthy behavior for him.</li>\n<li>One of the solutions, he came up with was to buy the Nintendo Ring Fit Adventure. He explained that this game lets you jog, squat, and exercise your arms through the utilization of a physical ring. </li>\n<li>He further emphasized that the details of the game made the boring process of exercises fascinating since you had objectives of beating the monsters and demons.</li>\n<li>He believes that the sense of accomplishment gained through the reward system of experience points, leveling up, and possibly sharing on social media was the source of motivation</li>\n<li>Though he enjoyed Ring Fit Adventure he only played it several times and believes that this was because he actually did not want to exercise that much. He stated that people who want to exercise will do and he is one who is not inclined to do so.</li>\n<li>He ended the interview by telling me that there is currently no incentive for him to work out since he does not have to see anyone, nor does he have to show his face during zoom classes.</li>\n<li>I learned from this user that he knows that not exercising is unhealthy but, in reality, is not inclined to work out even if there is a fun gaming component accompanying it. However, it seems that a sense of accomplishment together with human interaction was somewhat effective in order for him to start working out. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>User 2</h4>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t1i3p2wynjf8/6l32uboaYZi5kASIMpwkZJ/4a5c850847aaa34f38a04f4505d27123/____________________________2021-01-09_11.28.41.png\" alt=\"workout-user2\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>User 2 is also a university student in his senior year who enjoys playing ping pong.</li>\n<li>He was previously a varsity track athlete for the past three years of his college life but decided to relax and spend his last year in his dorm on campus.</li>\n<li>When I asked him if he could perform some exercises that he would do if he were to in his room, he showed me some stretches, push-ups, and sit-ups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t1i3p2wynjf8/4JFlZMlMvitGN8QQ93uqVM/d3a0a966500e8fa1ce484fa943d7bb04/____________________________2021-01-09_11.28.49.png\" alt=\"workout-user2-2\"></p>\n<ul>\n<li>His room is also very minimal in that most of the space is occupied by the bed, desk, and closet and so he does not have space to walk around. Therefore, his daily routine was very much associated with his desk and bed.</li>\n<li>He does in fact think of working out but feels lazy due to a lack of motivation</li>\n<li>The interesting point for me was how he stopped exercising even though he was a varsity athlete for the past three years. The reason behind this was because he did not have any expectations anymore. When he was an athlete, he was always expected by his coaches and team mates as well as himself to work out to perform better in his matches and this is what kept him going.</li>\n<li>When I questioned him about his ideal way to exercise, he touched on how much human interaction was important to make the process fun. He mentioned that rather than the traditional ways of working out in the gym by himself, he preferred exercising through playing, for example, frisbee. </li>\n<li>I learned that the important thing for continuing exercises is to have a fun experience and a set routine with human interactions so that you could motivate each other.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Comparative Analysis</h2>\n<h4>1. Combination of existing apps</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Two users chat on Facebook Messenger and decide that they want to exercise together. </li>\n<li>They schedule a good time by chatting and manually marking it in their individual calendars. </li>\n<li>On the day of their exercise, they first start the video call on Messenger, then search for some small space exercises on Google. </li>\n<li>After looking through few sites, they decide upon a set of exercise to do and works out synchronously through the Messenger video call. </li>\n<li>They time 30 minutes on their phone and when the alarm rings, they stop and quit the call. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This solution does well in that it is able to pursue the objective of doing small room exercises with two users together.</li>\n<li>To exercise together once, they need to use multiple platforms, (e.g. Messenger, calendar, Google, countdown timer) which is a hassle and consumes a lot of time. </li>\n<li>If individual user employs this method, it seems that it is not very sustainable as there are no source of motivation unless one is already a dedicated person. </li>\n<li>To solve this problem, my solution would need to have all of these core functionalities included in the status quo solution but without wasting time dealing with multiple platforms and choosing exercise from countless lists. </li>\n<li>To solve the motivation issue for individual users, we will need to focus on other tactics to increase their motivation such as by using the gaming component.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2. PEAR</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>PEAR – Personal Fitness Coach is a mobile app for exercises with video coaching that keeps track of your stats and also analyzes data from smartwatches. Additionally, it has an embedded music player system, PEAR Music, for users with membership that plays workout music of selected genre.\n<img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t1i3p2wynjf8/6BkINilrIzjCzgov9raDG9/3b4f4e73461954709d9df5a2e076e57b/____________________________2021-01-06_10.16.39.png\" alt=\"pear\"></li>\n<li>As shown by the screenshots, the app is easy to navigate with many categories of activities to choose from as well as the option to choose workouts from different durations. </li>\n<li>During the workout, there is a video that clearly teaches you what to do with a countdown timer. </li>\n<li>At the end of the workout, you are able to save your stats that is visible in your workout history. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This solution is well designed and easy to navigate where users can just rely on this single app to keep track of their exercises. </li>\n<li>While this may be a good solution for people who have large space to themselves, this does not work for my target population who live in a small space. </li>\n<li>Although it has a calendar functionality where you can supposedly schedule your workout, I was unable to find on the app where I can add my workout to this schedule. </li>\n<li>The other problem is that this app lacks source of motivation and only works for users who are already determined to continue working out.</li>\n<li>In my solution, I should only focus on workouts that are tailored to small spaces and have categories within them and an easier way to schedule workouts or more broadly, easier way to navigate in the app. </li>\n<li>I will need to focus on how to increase motivation, which I solve through human interaction and the gaming component. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Storyboard</h2>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t1i3p2wynjf8/6bk0Mquf8dCQCUIbxZdxNQ/962c5fcdc81f75e88fa8c550660bb9fb/stoayboard.png\" alt=\"workout storyboard\"></p>\n<h2>Prototypes</h2>\n<h4>Lo-Fi Paper Prototype</h4>\n<p><img src=\"//images.ctfassets.net/t1i3p2wynjf8/7DS8LMW8YZ6bE8zJQ7PhS4/1bee177b26a8e8580926ec399fb2305e/____________________________2021-01-09_11.49.14.png\" alt=\"workout-lofi\"></p>\n<h4>Hi-Fi Figma Mockup</h4>\n<iframe style=\"border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\" width=\"100%\" height=\"450\" src=\"https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FnNsFRZwuPFBJ1DlLUfq614%2FWorkOut\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<h2>Design Process/Loops</h2>\n<h4>Loop1</h4>\n<h5>Design</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>The problem in this loop was  how to make users who live in a small space exercise. </li>\n<li>The key insight I gained was through contextual inquiry. I realized that there were many students currently living in small spaces who cannot exercise because the gyms are closed and they do not want to go out since they fear the coronavirus. </li>\n<li>I found out that not only can they not physically go out to exercise, but they also lack the motivation to exercise inside their rooms. </li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Prototyping</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>I started off by searching for ideas through storyboarding. My two storyboards each tried to solve the problem of getting users to exercise through different ways of motivating them. </li>\n<li>My first storyboard used human interaction by having two users schedule to meet up and workout together on the app. The second was using a gaming component where the time spent on the app would increase an avatar’s experience points and the avatars will eventually evolve when you have reached a certain experience point. </li>\n<li>I decided to lo-fi prototype on paper my first idea. This was because during my contextual inquiry, one of my users who was a varsity athlete told me that human interaction was the key for him to practice persistently.</li>\n<li>In my prototype, I sketched a basic skeleton of the app with focused on how to schedule a workout between two users and how the actual workout session using a video call would look like. </li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Evaluation</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>I realized that incorporating direct human interaction in an exercising app is something new that was not present in previously and would attract users.</li>\n<li>Another aspect that distinguished this app from other solutions was that this app contained everything that is needed in one place, which lowered the barrier for exercising. </li>\n<li>The lo-fi prototype seemed to work and was clear about how to navigate from the feedback I had received. However, at the same time, I discovered many problems. For instance, I had not thought of how individual users would use my app and how they would get motivation from this as well as how I can keep users from continuously using the app.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Loop2</h4>\n<h5>Design</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>In this loop, the problem shifted from making users exercise in small spaces to a subproblem of how to encourage motivation so that users can exercise. </li>\n<li>From the feedback I received from my mentor, I decided to integrate the idea of human interaction and the gaming component into one solution. </li>\n<li>In order to discover a new hill, I considered encouraging users through the usage of risks. </li>\n<li>Specifically, to create a routine and encourage them to work out, I formulated an idea of if the user skips a regularly scheduled workout session, $5 would be automatically withdrawn from their bank account and donated to a political party that they hated. </li>\n<li>When I presented these ideas to my users, all of them told me that they like the first idea of incorporating a game. One of the reasons why they did not enjoy the latter was because this idea discouraged them from using the app even before they tried it. As my users are not the ones who would be self-motivated to exercise, such risky solution was not appealing to them at all. </li>\n<li>Additionally, I decided to go into detail about the interface design such as what kind of parameter for stats would encourage the users the most. To test this, I quickly lo-fi prototyped on paper two versions of the stats on the home screen, which were calories and time spent. </li>\n<li>I learned from my user that calories would be a better metric since time does not directly correspond to the intensity of the exercises and would not be an easy way to gauge how much effort you had spent. </li>\n<li>I investigated an app, Plant Nanny, where your avatar grows as you drink more water. Through this research, I gained some insight about how to structure my home screen with my newly added avatar feature. </li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Prototyping</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>After doing some additional paper lo-fi protype as described above, I decided to move forward with the project by creating a hi-fi prototype on Figma</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Evaluation</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>I have tested my prototype with a user for two use cases. </li>\n<li>One of them was navigating to the video call screen at the time of your scheduled session and the other was to schedule a workout session. </li>\n<li>In both cases, it seemed that the user was able to easily navigate through the interface to complete the task. </li>\n<li>I believe my current design is effective. </li>\n<li>From my inquiry, I learned that for users who are less motivated, it is better to encourage them through positivity such as human interaction and gaming rather than enforcing risks on them that raises the barrier for them to use the solution in the first place. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Design Solution</h2>\n<iframe src=\"https://codesandbox.io/embed/trusting-wood-pfz1g?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&view=preview\"\n     style=\"width:375px; height:850px; border:0; border-radius: 4px; overflow:hidden;\"\n     title=\"workout\"\n     allow=\"accelerometer; ambient-light-sensor; camera; encrypted-media; geolocation; gyroscope; hid; microphone; midi; payment; usb; vr; xr-spatial-tracking\"\n     sandbox=\"allow-forms allow-modals allow-popups allow-presentation allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"\n   ></iframe>\n<h4>Explanation</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>In the home screen, there are two major components. The first component is the status circle and the avatar with its level, which corresponds to the gaming component of this app. The progress circle shows you how much calories you have burnt so far and how far until you are to the next level of your avatar. The second component is the display of upcoming workouts. If one clicks on the scheduled workout at the time of their meet up, then it leads to a video call where you are able to exercise together with your partner. </li>\n<li>In the vide call screen, we have a prerecorded video where the instructor demonstrates how the exercises should be done on the top half. On the bottom half, you are able to see your partner exercising and yourself in a small window in case you would like to see your posture. There is also a countdown timer to indicate how much time is left. </li>\n<li>In the exercises screen, users are able to see a list of categories of exercises and once they pick one category, it leads to a more detailed page showcasing the specific exercises. </li>\n<li>When clicking a specific exercise, the user will be redirected to the Add Schedule page where they are able to schedule this specific exercise with a date, time, frequency, and a friend to work out with if any. </li>\n<li>Another place the user will be able to access this page will be through the schedule screen. On the schedule screen, we have a list of already scheduled events where you could press on them to access the video call when the time comes similar to the upcoming workouts on the home screen. </li>\n<li>Finally, we have the profile page where it displays your profile picture along with your current avatar. Other sections include the friends button where if you press it, it would lead to a page with a list of friends (not implemented) and the pending invitations from your friends. Here, you are able to either press the check or x mark to accept or decline the request. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Future Work</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Search for a better way to address the individual users. Since currently we only have a simple gaming component, it is hard to say if individual users will truly be motivated from this. The gaming component could perhaps be extended into the video call with an interactive game. </li>\n<li>How to make the invitations more efficient. Currently, the invitation is one-way, which may cause some extra time on the users since they do not know about the other user’s schedule and will need to ping-pong invitations until they both find a good time. Therefore, it may be suitable if users can show other users when they are free beforehand so that the other user can simply book them. </li>\n<li>The greatest risk that I still face is how I can make my users follow through. My challenge is that more than having my users be motivated by the human interaction and gaming component but about how they can keep this motivation persistently. This is because if they are unable to get into a routine, users can easily quit and since there is an emphasis on working out together, if one quits, then the other user may also quit, which means we lose multiple users at once. To mitigate this risk, I need to investigate on the topic of routine work and what existing methods are there to encourage this. After investigating the effective methods, I should perform user studies with each of the methods to determine which method works the best for my user population. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Final Evaluation</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Looking back at my progress, I believe I was able to do well on my contextual inquiry gaining some key insights about how I should focus on a subproblem and my prototyping as well as implementation. </li>\n<li>However, at the same time, I believe I should have cut corners during my prototyping and implementation stage. This is because I believe I was swaying between my main problem of having an exercising app for small spaces and my subproblem of encouraging motivation for users. Therefore, rather than focusing completely on the interfaces dedicated to motivating the users, I also implemented pages such as the one displaying a list of arms exercises, which primarily addresses the main problem. </li>\n<li>By cutting this corner, I hope that I will be able to spend some time on thinking about the invitation system so that this does not become a source of losing motivation.</li>\n</ul>"}},"heroImage":{"file":{"url":"//images.ctfassets.net/t1i3p2wynjf8/2T2mSVVfT1nx9IQKmDBPzT/32824196c8f33527dc4a49d951c60e1c/iPhone_X_on_charging_dock.jpg"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"work-out-design"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
