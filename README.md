# eureyuri portfolio website
This is my new website specifically as a resume.

## Motivation / Description
I realized v1.0 had many design issues to be a resume since there were many clicks to be made to reach the important content.
Here, I focused more on design to deliver the most important information on single page and hid extra information aside in case any one is interested.

## How I built it
- React
- Firebase

## Run Project
1. Clone the project
2. `npm i`
3. `npm start` to run in development mode
4. `npm run build` to build for production
