# eureyuri portfolio website
This is my new website specifically as a resume.

## Motivation / Description
I realized v1.0 had many design issues to be a resume since there were many clicks to be made to reach the important content.
Here, I focused more on design to deliver the most important information on single page and hid extra information aside in case any one is interested.
Also, since I have recently learned React, I will be using what I learned to build this site.

## How I built it
- Gatsby (React + GraphQL)
- Typography.js

## Run Project
1. `gatsby new project-name https://github.com/eureyuri/eureyuri_website_v2`
2. `cd project-name`
3. `gatsby develop` to run in development mode
4. `gatsby build` to build for production
